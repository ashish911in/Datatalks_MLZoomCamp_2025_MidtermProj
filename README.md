# Datatalks MLZoomCamp 2025 Midterm Project
The midterm project of Datatalks MLZoomCamp 2025 (Sep to Jan 2026)
Currently Cloned onto Local PC.

## Package manager used
I have used conda as the package manager. Therefore, an environment.yml file has been created

## Required Libraries (so far) are
1. Numpy
2. scikitlearn
3. pandas
4. ML model libraries

## Optional Libraries are
1. KaggleHub

## Variable pre-start entries
A properties file or a json file containing following entries (at least):
1. Data from URL or no
2. Data file location (URL or local dir path)
3. Data file name
4. Target Feature name and type

## Current progress
Learning how to do stuff locally

## Current Situation
Not sure if the dataset I have selected is worth it. Still researching. May switch dataset

## Dataset
The dataset I have so far is 
    Date:'solar radation'
    Filetype: 'csv'
    Description: 'will be added'

## Target
To predict or calculate solar radiation based on other features

## Next step
1. To calculate total sunlight time from sunset, sunrise difference
2. The time data was measured has impact but by how much
3. To plot and get the correlation between each feature
4. How much impact each feature has on target feature
...
N. Which regressor to use
